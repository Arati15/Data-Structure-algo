Binary search is used to search a key element from multiple elements. Binary search is faster than linear search.

In case of binary search, array elements must be in ascending order. If you have unsorted array, you can sort the array using Arrays.sort(arr) method.


public static void binarySearch(int a[], x, int first, int last)
{
    //we need to find array mid
    int mid = (first + last)/ 2;
    while(first <= last){
        if (a [mid] < x)
        {
            first = mid +1;
        }
        else if (a [mid] == x){
            println("element found" +mid);
            break;
        }
        else{
            last = mid -1;
        }
        mid = (first +last)/ 2;
    }
    if (first > last)
    {
        Element not found;
    }

}
